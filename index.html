    Founded in the early 2010s by the originals as an answer to the tedium of one bounce, patties is a sport played by all parts of the body apart from feet, with the aim to keep the ball from bouncing twice by <em>any means necessary</em>.<br>
    A lives-based sport with competitors typically starting on 3â€“5 lives. Lives are lost through being "at fault" for the ball bouncing twice before being touched by another participant.
