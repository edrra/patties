    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>Patties requires more than one participant and a ball of some kind (does not have to be round) to begin.\n Roughly speaking, balloons are too soft, while cricket balls are probably too hard. These are the only requirements to start a game of patties</p>
    <h2>The Serve</h2>
    <p> Generally participants are expected to stand in a circle prior to starting the game. The game is started by one of the participants serving the ball in a similar fashion to volleyball into the interior of the circle (serves hit outside of the circle should be retaken).\n Players also cannot lose a life off of a serve - meaning: if player A serves, and player B is then at fault for consecutive bounce (CB), player B will not lose a life, and the serve will be retaken. Similarly if player A is at fault, the serve will be retaken. \n This is to avoid unsavoury behaviour such as 'spiking' where the server will aggressively project the ball into an unsuspecting nearby competitor. \n Note, the circle related laws only apply in the case of more than two participants</p>
    <h2>Middle/end game</h2>
    <p> Once we proceed from the serve stage, we are immediately in the middle/end game of the round. At this point, participants will aim to keep the ball from bouncing twice. Note the spirit of the game is to keep the ball from bouncing twice for as long as possible, so off ball intentional physical alterications will result in an immediate loss of life </p>
    <h2>Determination of fault in fair play</h2>
    <p> Determination of fault for CB is ultimately a group decision. Examples of fault are:
    <ul>
  <li>Being the last person to touch the ball before a CB, in such a way that no other individual could have touched the ball prior to the CB taking place</li>
  <li>Being a participant who, prior to a CB, could have touched the ball but did not. The underlying cause of this could be due to slow reactions, or not wanting to risk patting the ball poorly and then being at fault for CB. Generally, if a player at any point moves away from the ball after the last patt takes place, or does not move *at all* prior to a CB when they were closest to it, this results in loss of life</li>
  </ul>
     Note crucially here, determining whether a player could have touched the ball prior to a CB is a function of that participants physical ability. FEATHA (From Each According To His Ability) is generally a good guide here
   </p>
   <h2>Determination of falut in unfair play</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> intentional use of feet </li>
    <li> intentional off ball physical altercations/use of weapons </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Bad practice</h2>
    <p> While not strictly in the laws, Patties is at its heart a social game. Players who do not play in the spirit of banishing CB will generally speaking be identified and potentially have international titles revoked by committee. Ultimately, at its heart patties is an honour based sport. While all players want to win, all players should strive to avoid unecessary CB and gain join from long strings of mono bounces. Bad practise includes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Not running after other players who are chasing a ball outside the circle to offer support </li>
    <li> Running away from high activity locations on the pitch to leave others to avoid CB</li>
    <li> Intentionally deflating a ball prior to the end of a game in order to avoid an unwanted outcom </li>
    <li> Aggressive targetting of less mobile players </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lives</h2>
    <p> All players at a beginning of a round will start on an equal number of lives - generally speaking this is between 3 and 5. For longer games, at each players exit from the game, all lives are reset to the same number (usually the amount they had at the start of the game) - for quicker games, lives do not refresh. When a player is out of lives, they exit from the game</p>
    <h3>The Mother Patty</h3>
    <p>If a player loses their last life, and all other players are on 1 life or more, the player does not exit the game but is instead given the 'mother patty'. If another player on one life then loses a life, they exit the game. If the player on the mother patty life loses a life, that player is then eliminated, and the mother patty life then becomes available again. </p>
    <h2> Let </h2>
    <p> If it is too difficult to determine who is at fault for a CB, the point can be 'let' on consensus and the point is replayed. While sometimes needed, generally the quality of a patties game can be determined by amount of lets - the fewer the better. Generally speaking, a high let game is an indicator of a poorly officiated match </p>
    <h3> Perpendicular Bisector </h3>
    <p> One common example of let is perpendicular bisector. This generally occurs when the ball is patted in such a way that it at all points on its trajectory equal distance from two players and the patt results in a CB. Often an indicator that both participants are at fault, typically the point is replayed, though there are some who believe both players ought to be penalised </p>
    <h2> The winner </h2>
    <p> The winner of a patties contest is the last participant left with lives. Winners of multiple grand slams and international contests are granted the title "God of Patties" (GOP) </p>
